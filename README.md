**QCing, mapping, and annotating RNAs of** ***Nannochloropsis salina*** **CCMP1776** were conducted for a collaborative work with **Prof. Nam Kyu Kang at KHU**. Plus, Minsik's lab is encharge of statistical analyses to find out how the microalgal pathways expressed differently based on different culture conditions, by time.

*Quality control and data reprocessing*

Quality control, trimming, alignment, filtering, annotation and quantification

The quality of raw RNA-seq reads was initially assessed using FastQC v0.11.9 [^1] to evaluate metrics such as per base sequence quality, GC content, and adapter contamination. Low-quality reads and adapter sequences were removed using Trimmomatic v0.39 [^2] with parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20, and MINLEN:36. High-quality paired-end reads were retained for downstream analysis. The Nannochloropsis salina CCMP1776 reference genome (GCA_004565275.1) and the corresponding annotation files were obtained from NCBI. The genome was indexed using HISAT2 v2.2.1 [^3] with [include any specific parameters]. High-quality reads were aligned to the reference genome using HISAT2 with the parameter -p 48 for efficient multi-threading. Aligned reads were converted to BAM format, sorted, and indexed using Samtools v1.10 [^4]. Gene-level quantification was performed using featureCounts v2.0.1 [^5] with parameters -T 48 to specify the number of threads. Functional annotation of gene models was performed using eggNOG-mapper v2 [^6] with database version 5.0.0. Annotated reads were then quantified, and the proportion of contaminants was determined based on alignment statistics and post-alignment QC results. Post-alignment QC was performed using tools such as FastQC, Picard [^7], SAMtools, and Qualimap [^8] to ensure the quality of alignments and identify potential issues.
